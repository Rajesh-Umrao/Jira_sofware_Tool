    <h1>Methodology Overview</h1>
    <p>The software development methodology is a process by which developers design, implement, and test new computer software projects. It involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How to develop and test a project</li>
        <li>How to release the project</li>
        <li>How to manage the roadmap and project milestones</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
    <p>The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. Hereâ€™s an example of an Agile approach:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a plan for 15 days.</li>
        <li>Development according to the plan.</li>
        <li>Test the project according to the plan.</li>
        <li>Get feedback from the customer.</li>
        <li>Start the next plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agile Framework</h2>
    <p>Main types of Agile frameworks include:</p>
    
    <h3>1) Scrum</h3>
    <p>Scrum is a framework of Agile methodology that organizes work into short, time-boxed iterations called sprints (1-4 weeks). It focuses on delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.</p>
    
    <h4>Key Elements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> A prioritized list of all tasks/features to be done.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> Tasks selected for the current sprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Stand-ups:</strong> Short daily meetings to track progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives:</strong> Meetings to reflect on the sprint's work and improve.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Roles</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Represents the customer, manages the backlog.</li>
        <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> Ensures the Scrum process is followed and removes blockers.</li>
        <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> Executes the work and delivers increment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2) Kanban</h3>
    <p>Kanban is another Agile framework that emphasizes continuous delivery and improvement by visualizing the workflow and limiting work in progress.</p>

    <h2>Sprint</h2>
    <p>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a Scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprint duration should be less than 4 weeks.</p>
    
    <h3>Plan and Execution of a Sprint</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Estimate how much work can be done.</li>
        <li>Sprint Grooming.</li>
        <li>Daily Scrum meeting.</li>
        <li>Sprint Retrospective.</li>
        <li>Sprint Demo.</li>
    </ul>
